# In a terminal session, Python simply returns the result of the operation. 
# Python uses two multiplication symbols to represent exponents
print(3 % 2)
# The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of the division of the first number by the second.
# For example, 3 divided by 2 is 1 with a remainder of 1, so 3 % 2 returns 1.
# The result of the operation is printed to the terminal.
print(3 + 2 * 5)
# The order of operations is followed, so multiplication is performed before addition.
print((3 + 2) * 5)
# Parentheses can be used to change the order of operations.
print(3 + 2 * 5 - 1)
# The order of operations is followed, so multiplication is performed before addition and subtraction.
print(3 + 2 * (5 - 1))
# Parentheses can be used to change the order of operations.
print(3 + 2 * (5 - 1) / 2)
# The order of operations is followed, so multiplication and division are performed before addition.
print(3 + 2 * (5 - 1) / 2 ** 2)
# Parentheses can be used to change the order of operations, and exponents are evaluated before multiplication and division.
print(3 + 2 * (5 - 1) / 2 ** 2 % 3)
# The order of operations is followed, so exponents are evaluated before multiplication and division, and the modulus operator is applied last.
# The result of the operation is printed to the terminal.
print(3 + 2 * (5 - 1) / 2 ** 2 % 3 // 2)
# The order of operations is followed, so exponents are evaluated before multiplication and division, and the modulus operator is applied last.
# The result of the operation is printed to the terminal.

# The order of operations is followed, so exponents are evaluated before multiplication and division, and the modulus operator is applied last.
